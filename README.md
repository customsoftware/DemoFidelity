I built this to teach myself how to integrate UIKit views within a SwiftUI app. It's fairly simple, but there's enough here to show one way to do it. I may add a combine centric approach in the future, but for now, this works. Help yourself to the code. It's pretty simple. 

For legal purposes, use of this code is AS-IS, you the developer assume all liability and hold Custom Software free of any liability for your use of this code.

Enjoy.
